      <p><em>Keep this list to yourself. Do not share it with anyone.</em></p>

      <p>(Or do. But don't say we didn't warn you.)</p>

      <h2>Intelligence is not fixed</h2>

      <p>The notion that we are born with a set level of intelligence and die with it is one of the most comforting lies in our culture. In truth, the human brain is an extraordinarily plastic machine. Intelligence fluctuates across the day, the week, the years. There are peaks and there are valleys. And there are ways — concrete, testable, repeatable — to have more peaks, to make those peaks higher, and to stop wasting the ones we already have.</p>

      <p>We are not talking about "productivity tips" or "morning habits of billionaires." We are talking about <strong>computational tricks</strong>: changes in the way we process information that make us, literally and measurably, smarter. Many of these techniques come from fields as diverse as computer science, evolutionary biology, cognitive audiology, game theory, and analytic philosophy. Others come simply from years of work with hundreds of students — children, teenagers, adults — and from careful observation of what separates people who solve problems from people who get stuck in them.</p>

      <h2>Why bother becoming smarter?</h2>

      <p>We live in the age of artificial intelligence. Some argue it is no longer worth investing in human intelligence. The opposite is true: <strong>if we cannot evaluate what AI produces, we become hostages to it</strong>. A pilot who cannot read the instruments is not helped by the technology — he is controlled by it. Artificial intelligence amplifies human intelligence, but only when human intelligence exists. Otherwise, it amplifies stupidity.</p>

      <p>Greater intelligence means a greater capacity to solve problems, to see opportunities where others see walls, to create things that did not exist before. It is the difference between living in reaction to the world and living by design.</p>

      <p>The utopia of altering our hardware — our "flesh" — has proved, for now, limited. But we can upgrade our software. And it is a shame that this peculiar and sublime human flesh is sometimes so remarkably unintelligent.</p>

      <p>Here are 30 tricks. You will not find them easily elsewhere. They are the product of a great deal of thought, a great many experiments with a great many people, over a great many years.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>The 30 tricks</h2>

      <h3>1. Understand the evaluator</h3>
      <p>When an agent wants to be intelligent, the first intelligent step is to understand <em>who evaluates</em> intelligence. This goes well beyond simply optimising for a goal — it means understanding how the goal itself will be judged. ChatGPT appeared dramatically smarter the moment humans taught it the kind of response they actually favour — the same principle that already governed TikTok's and YouTube's recommendation algorithms. And note: the evaluator may be you. A more radical position is to try changing the evaluator altogether, but that takes us into terrifying philosophical territory.</p>

      <h3>2. Try symmetry operations</h3>
      <p>The opposite of a good idea can be a great idea. <em>Reductio ad Absurdum</em> is one of the most powerful tools in logic: assume the opposite and derive an absurd conclusion to prove the original statement was true. But the same mechanism can be used to generate solutions — ironically, good ones. And there are symmetries beyond mere opposites: translations, rotations, inversions of scale. An architect who flips a blueprint upside down spots errors that were invisible the right way up.</p>

      <h3>3. Be counter-productive on purpose</h3>
      <p>Instead of searching for the solution to a problem, ask: <em>what actions would make it worse?</em> Gary Klein's Pre-Mortem method does exactly this — imagine the project has already failed, then work backwards to figure out why. Surgeons train first by identifying everything that can go wrong, before they ever operate. Mapping the disaster is often the fastest route to the solution.</p>

      <h3>4. Backward induction</h3>
      <p>Start from the end. Chess grandmasters do not think move by move — they begin by visualising the desired final position and work backwards to the present. In game theory, this is called <em>backward induction</em>, and it is the canonical method for solving sequential games. A student who starts with the result they want on the exam and traces back to what they need to study today is more effective than one who "starts from the beginning."</p>

      <h3>5. Self-nudges</h3>
      <p>New Caledonian crows manufacture tools and store them for future use — a <em>nudge</em> that the present crow prepares for the future crow. We can do the same: carry around subconscious-priming cards, strategic Post-its, reminders we cannot ignore. The trick is to use confirmation bias in our favour — we start finding clues that align with the problem we want to solve. But beware: if the nudge can be ignored, it will be.</p>

      <h3>6. Caching</h3>
      <p>Computer processors use cache memory — a fast copy of the most frequently accessed data. We can do the same: regularly review the most important information to keep it fresh in the mind. Keep a list of mental algorithms (like this one) always to hand. The surgeon who reviews the surgical protocol before every operation does not do so because she has forgotten it — she does it because she wants it in cache.</p>

      <h3>7. Hunt for analogies</h3>
      <p>Penicillin emerged from a mould that contaminated a Petri dish — Alexander Fleming recognised the pattern because he had seen it in another context. Lateral thinking, formalised by Edward de Bono, is precisely this: the solution already exists, but somewhere else and wearing a different face. Darwin developed natural selection by using as an analogy the artificial selection that pigeon breeders had long practised. When you are stuck, ask: <em>where has this problem already been solved?</em></p>

      <h3>8. Make combinations</h3>
      <p>The iPhone did not invent the mobile phone, or the music player, or the web browser. It combined all three. Most "inventions" are recombinations of things that already existed. Genetic algorithms in computing do precisely this: they cross existing solutions to produce better offspring. A five-year-old mixing Lego from different sets is intuitively practising one of the most powerful engines of innovation.</p>

      <h3>9. Live with paradoxes</h3>
      <p>Light is both a wave and a particle at the same time. Quantum mechanics only advanced when physicists accepted living with that contradiction instead of forcing it to disappear. Niels Bohr argued that opposites are complementary, not mutually exclusive. When something seems to make no sense whatsoever, rather than discarding it, give it time. That is frequently where the next layer of understanding lies.</p>

      <h3>10. Synchrony</h3>
      <p>An orchestra of brilliant musicians playing out of sync is just noise. Sometimes every element of a solution already exists — they simply are not aligned in time. Pasteur had both the observation and the theory, but the rabies vaccine only worked when both converged with a practical opportunity. Some solutions are not found; they are waited for — or worked towards until "the stars align."</p>

      <h3>11. Think in diesel</h3>
      <p>A not-very-green analogy, but an illuminating one: some mental processes take time and give few conscious signals while they work. The mathematician Henri Poincare described how his greatest discoveries emerged after weeks of unconscious incubation — not during active effort. Even a computer, when it runs a bit slowly, makes the human user want to cancel the process. But often it was nearly there.</p>

      <h3>12. Follow the gradient</h3>
      <p>A dog tracking a scent uses a brilliant optimisation algorithm: it follows the direction where the smell is strongest, adjusting at every step. In machine learning, this is called <em>gradient descent</em>, and it is the foundation of all modern artificial intelligence. For us: at each decision, move in the direction where things seem to be improving. You do not need to see the destination — you need to feel the slope.</p>

      <h3>13. Use noise</h3>
      <p>The <em>simulated annealing</em> algorithm, inspired by the slow cooling of metals, deliberately injects noise into the search process to escape local minima — traps that look good but are not the best. A company that hires people from completely unrelated fields is injecting noise. A student reading about biology while stuck on an engineering problem is doing the same. Overly "tidy" ways of thinking do not explore the full search space.</p>

      <h3>14. Use randomness</h3>
      <p>Francis Galton asked a crowd at the Plymouth fair to guess the weight of an ox. The average of their answers was more accurate than any individual estimate — including those of the experts. Randomness, when aggregated, converges on the truth. In problem-solving, generating random options and then filtering can find solutions that sequential logic would never reach. Monte Carlo algorithms, used to simulate everything from nuclear physics to finance, are literally this.</p>

      <h3>15. Use your own seeds</h3>
      <p>In complex systems, the starting position can determine everything. An optimisation algorithm launched from a different point may find a completely different — and better — solution. Every person has a unique history, perspective, and set of experiences. Sometimes someone with less raw capacity can reach a solution inaccessible to everyone else, simply because they started from a position nobody else occupies. Your idiosyncrasies are not noise — they are seeds.</p>

      <h3>16. Use natural selection</h3>
      <p>Many stubborn iterations of two phases: diversity (generate variants) and selection (kill the bad ones). This is how life produces eyes, wings, brains — with no engineer. Evolutionary algorithms in computing replicate this process to solve engineering problems no human can optimise directly. For us: generate many ideas without judgement, then be ruthless in selection. Repeat.</p>

      <h3>17. Delegate</h3>
      <p>Leafcutter ants do not digest leaves — they delegate that task to a fungus they cultivate. We can delegate to tomorrow (let the subconscious process it overnight), to someone else (nobody knows everything), to the computer (calculators exist for a reason). The trick is knowing <em>what</em> to delegate and <em>to whom</em>. Einstein declared he never memorised anything he could look up in a book — he delegated memory so he could concentrate on thought.</p>

      <h3>18. Set bounds</h3>
      <p>The Fermi method — used by the physicist Enrico Fermi to estimate anything from the number of piano tuners in Chicago to the yield of an atomic bomb — starts by establishing extreme limits. <em>At least X, at most Y.</em> Even without knowing the answer, we know it falls within that range. This dramatically reduces the search space and is surprisingly effective for problems that seem impossible to approach.</p>

      <h3>19. Close in</h3>
      <p>After setting bounds, narrow them. Forensic scientists use this technique: first they define the crime's time window, then they tighten it with each new piece of evidence. Programmers use <em>binary search</em> — at each step, they eliminate half the possibilities. With every narrowing, the problem shrinks exponentially. Three rounds of bisection eliminate 87.5% of the search space.</p>

      <h3>20. Abstract</h3>
      <p>There are always multiple levels of depth at which a problem can be considered. A map is not the territory, but it is far more useful for navigation. A circuit diagram is not the real circuit, but it allows us to reason about it. Children who learn mathematics with physical blocks before moving on to abstract symbols understand concepts more deeply — because they climbed levels organically. Creating maps, symbols, colours that represent the thing more abstractly can exponentially increase our capacity to think about it.</p>

      <h3>21. Think in networks</h3>
      <p>Organise ideas into nodes (elements) and edges (relations between elements). Google's PageRank works this way: it does not evaluate each page in isolation but by its position in the network of links. Our brains and the neural networks of AI are, fundamentally, integrated memories — information in an inherently interconnected format, not in separate boxes. The mere act of explicitly connecting ideas can allow the solution to flow naturally.</p>

      <h3>22. Chunking</h3>
      <p>Chess grandmasters do not memorise individual piece positions — they memorise patterns (chunks) of four or five pieces. That is why they can reconstruct entire boards from memory but fail with randomly placed pieces. The psychologist George Miller showed that human working memory holds roughly seven chunks, regardless of each chunk's size. Breaking a problem into sub-problems is multiplying the cognitive capacity available to solve it.</p>

      <h3>23. Play with distance</h3>
      <p>The telescope and the microscope are the same invention at different distances. Stepping back from a problem (sleeping on it, travelling, working on something else) gives perspective. Zooming in (examining a detail obsessively) gives depth. And often the very act of alternating between near and far — the <em>zoom in/zoom out</em> — holds the key. Film directors know this: cutting from a wide shot to a close-up completely changes the meaning of a scene.</p>

      <h3>24. Process in parallel</h3>
      <p>Multitasking usually backfires because of the constant switching cost between tasks. But doing several things genuinely at the same time can be both possible and desirable — listening to a podcast while driving, letting the computer crunch data while you write. The brain does this constantly: while we read, it simultaneously processes vision, language, memory, and emotion. The trick is to distinguish tasks that compete for the same resource (two verbal tasks) from tasks that use different channels.</p>

      <h3>25. Think out loud</h3>
      <p>There is a difference between thinking purely in your imagination and actually externalising it — writing, speaking, drawing. <em>Rubber duck debugging</em> is a famous practice among programmers: explaining the code to a rubber duck (literally) often makes the bug appear. This works because the perception of something that came "from outside" — even though we produced it ourselves — activates cognitive circuits different from those of mere imagination. To explain is to think twice.</p>

      <h3>26. Feedback</h3>
      <p>A living organism without feedback dies. The thermostat is the most underrated invention in engineering: it measures, compares, adjusts. Continuously. A student who takes a test and never sees the corrected answers is shooting at a target in the dark. Feedback can be slow (annual results) or fast (a colleague reacting in real time). It can be positive (reinforcement) or negative (correction). But it must exist.</p>

      <h3>27. Feedforward</h3>
      <p>The opposite of feedback: instead of correcting after the fact, guide beforehand. A Formula 1 driver does not wait to go off the track before correcting — the engineer tells him in advance, "tight corner in 200 metres." Before an important presentation, asking for guidance from someone who has been through the same thing is feedforward. It is turning someone else's experience into your own foresight.</p>

      <h3>28. Compounding</h3>
      <p>Warren Buffett is not rich because he made one good investment — he is rich because each investment yielded returns on the previous one, for decades. Compound interest is "the eighth wonder of the world," attributed to Einstein (probably apocryphal, but the idea is real). Thinking on top of what you have already thought, and so on. Knowledge accumulates non-linearly: someone who knows a bit of biology and a bit of engineering does not know twice as much — they know exponentially more, because they can cross-pollinate the two.</p>

      <h3>29. Expand working memory</h3>
      <p>The number of things we can "hold" in conscious awareness is absurdly low — roughly four to seven items. A child counting on their fingers is using somatic working memory — they have expanded their mental space into their body. A mathematician writing on a whiteboard is expanding their memory into physical space. We use notebooks, computers, maps, other people. The secret is to accept that the mind alone is severely limited — and to equip it without shame.</p>

      <h3>30. Sleep, eat, drink, move</h3>
      <p>Never forget that the nervous system is a <em>living</em> system. It needs cleaning (the glymphatic system literally flushes the brain during sleep), fuel (glucose is the primary energy source), hydration, and movement (physical exercise demonstrably increases BDNF, a protein that promotes neurogenesis). A phone with no battery, overheating, or dropped in the toilet does not work. And we are slightly more complicated than a phone.</p>

      <h2>Final note</h2>

      <p>These tricks are not theoretical. They are used daily in our programmes, adapted to each student, each age group, each challenge. They are the result of years of work with minds of all ages — from six-year-olds to senior professionals.</p>

      <p>Intelligence is not a fixed talent. It is a <strong>muscle trained with the right techniques</strong>.</p>

      <p>If you have made it this far, you are already smarter than when you started reading.</p>
