      <blockquote>
        "Pass, bird, pass, And teach me to pass."
        <cite>— Fernando Pessoa</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Nothing about this topic is discussed here in a pejorative sense. There is simply a specialized and adapted focus that should be applied, both to avoid harming the happiness and abilities of these young people and to make the most of them.</p>

      <p>The gifted need the world and the world needs the gifted!</p>

      <p>It seems obvious to note that it wasn't the "average" person who put <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/air-space-magazine/twenty-people-who-made-apollo-happen-180972374/" target="_blank">Man on the Moon</a> or discovered how to <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/jennifer-doudna-and-emmanuelle-charpentier-win-2020-nobel-prize-chemistry" target="_blank">easily edit a human genome</a> or wrote the poem <a href="https://poets.org/poem/im-nobody-who-are-you-260" target="_blank">"I'm Nobody! Who are you?"</a>. Civilization is <em>dependent</em> on exceptional people, gifted in something beyond the normal.</p>

      <p>Another obvious observation is how poorly adapted schools, and often even families, are to these young people. And there's no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate" target="_blank">Ritalin</a> that solves this maladaptation.</p>

      <p>Imagine what it would be like to find the child Albert Einstein and have him lead such a misfit, miserable, and unhappy life that we would never actually have the Albert Einstein we know. How many children is this happening to <em>right now</em>?</p>

      <p>The word "gifted" has become slang for the super-nerd or intellectual oddball of the family. This popular wisdom is understandable. But it's important to be much more technical and empathetic, so we don't end up with either overwhelming praise or anti-social insults.</p>

      <p>Try the following mental exercise. Open YouTube now and choose a video with someone speaking. (Actually do it, come on, don't be a spoilsport...) Now put the video at a very slow speed. Imagine how boring it is to deal with the "normal" world like this. Now put it at maximum speed. Imagine what it's like for outsiders to tune into the cacophony going on in the young person's head and the kind of challenges they get themselves into.</p>

      <p>A gifted person <em>thinks more</em>. And sometimes involuntarily, as if being dragged by thought.</p>

      <p>Note that none of this means they are necessarily more or less hardworking, intelligent, or creative in practice. For example, how understood they already are and how well-adapted they already are can make all the difference. It is precisely because of this difference between potential and results that all of this matters.</p>

      <h2>Characteristics of Gifted Young People</h2>

      <p><em>Note first of all that there is a whole continuum and that we may be biased in our evaluation. There is also the issue of attention deficit and hyperactivity, which may exist and be something different. Be critical and always play devil's advocate too. And consult a professional to help you.</em></p>

      <ol>
        <li>Advanced in language skills compared to peers.</li>
        <li>Difficulty making choices; wants to explore everything.</li>
        <li>High capacity for understanding and intuition, but may have difficulty communicating them.</li>
        <li>Can get stuck in infinite analysis loops about something basic.</li>
        <li>Propensity to hyper-intellectualize topics and situations.</li>
        <li>Resistance to behavioral changes. Sometimes this implies aversion to trying things outside the comfort zone or where they previously noticed failures or poor results.</li>
        <li>Frustration and lack of motivation in tasks perceived as "easy."</li>
        <li>Dislike of standardized tests.</li>
        <li>Hypersensitivity or over-excitability in various areas.</li>
        <li>Tendency to depend more on theory than experience.</li>
        <li>Idealistic nature.</li>
        <li>Preference for learning material rather than fiction literature.</li>
        <li>Advanced cognitive development, but possible delays in social skills.</li>
        <li>High IQ. That is, here, by definition, and in a quite measurable way, better than the majority. For example, in a random group of 50 children of the same age, they are the most cognitively advanced, appearing to be older than they are.</li>
        <li>Difficulty conforming to social norms.</li>
        <li>Asynchronous development (intellectual, emotional, and social).</li>
        <li>Propensity for boredom.</li>
        <li>Ability to perceive details and patterns that others don't notice.</li>
        <li>Tendency toward perfectionism and obsession.</li>
        <li>Can get lost in grand daydreaming narratives.</li>
        <li>More susceptible to burnout.</li>
        <li>Feelings of inadequacy and shame.</li>
        <li>Avoids evaluations where they fear failure.</li>
        <li>Often performs very poorly and unproductively on one task and then super-productively and unstoppably on another. Clear discontinuities are noticeable.</li>
        <li>Has self-directed, autonomous, and passionate learning.</li>
        <li>Insatiable curiosity and unusual creativity.</li>
        <li>Propensity for social isolation.</li>
        <li>Dissatisfaction with superficial conversations and explanations.</li>
        <li>Thinking that branches into multiple possibilities.</li>
        <li>Advanced sense of humor and fertile imagination.</li>
        <li>Inability to ignore problems and strong desire to solve them.</li>
        <li>Sensitivity to injustice and tendency toward anxiety.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What to Do With Gifted Young People?</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Try to understand the neuroscience and psychology of the topic (seriously, not the superficial stuff you find on Instagram or in magazines for "cultured" people).</li>
        <li>They should learn to create a certain identification with and separation from mental content. Otherwise they live hostage to their cognitive supercomputer. Here clearly physical activities, meditation, yoga, etc., can be fundamental.</li>
        <li>Keep up with the child's pace, giving them appropriate challenges.</li>
        <li>Understand and don't forget that often if we are brilliantly "freaks" about something society likes, then fine, if we have the misfortune to be one in a way it doesn't like or doesn't even know it likes or doesn't like yet, then the guy is a little crazy, poor thing.</li>
        <li>Don't be afraid to recognize and accept that your child is gifted.</li>
        <li>Don't do the opposite either, putting them on such a pedestal that they feel pressured and feel like a disaster when they fail at a superhuman challenge they got into.</li>
        <li>Encourage practical experiences beyond theoretical study. Even when reality seems unintelligent or basic, it's still more important than theory, because it is in fact reality.</li>
        <li>Communicate openly, showing support and understanding.</li>
        <li>Make sure the child has people in their life who understand and support them. Their age or older.</li>
        <li>Encourage experimentation and trying without fear of failure.</li>
        <li>Avoid vague comparisons with others and value the learning process.</li>
        <li>Recognize that even gifted people need strategies to overcome challenges.</li>
        <li>Help detect above-average abilities and below-average abilities.</li>
        <li>Educate about the need to invest very large time and resources when the goals are also very large. Even when apparently a gifted person is doing a task equal to a peer of the same age, they may be doing it in an internally much more difficult way.</li>
        <li>Help them find activities that allow them to use their abilities.</li>
        <li>Realize that in certain things there's no problem not being equal to others, quite the contrary.</li>
        <li>Realize that in certain things it's good to be at least in harmony with others. Not contributing to the oddball stereotype.</li>
        <li>Be careful with video games. As can be understood from what has been described here, it's natural that this type of young person finds in games exactly the type of cognitive and social stimulation that fits them perfectly and where they find people like them. They must not literally fall only into this and give up looking for such a fit elsewhere.</li>
        <li>Praise the effort and strategies adopted, rather than focusing only on results ("process praise").</li>
        <li>Create an environment that encourages mastery-based learning rather than just performance.</li>
        <li>Monitor potential bullying and social integration and train what to look for and what to avoid.</li>
        <li>Offer opportunities for deepening and study in areas of interest.</li>
        <li>Teach time management skills and goal setting and accomplishment.</li>
        <li>Teach to divide effort between moving things forward routinely and breaking new challenges, often chaotic.</li>
        <li>Offer emotional support and, if necessary, seek support from professionals.</li>
        <li>Share experiences with other parents in similar situations.</li>
        <li>Teach about the importance of empathy and the value of social skills.</li>
        <li>Stimulate self-reflection and the development of emotional intelligence.</li>
        <li>Be attentive and open to discussions about justice and ethics.</li>
        <li>Encourage the development of self-regulation skills.</li>
        <li>Don't be too politically correct with them, in the sense that often parents want to appear very understanding and the gifted child receives from them feedback that is either very poor or even false.</li>
        <li>Help them find mentors or role models who can inspire them.</li>
        <li>Direct them to opportunities to contribute to the community or participate in meaningful projects.</li>
      </ol>
